"""pin-boundary.py — address a segment by WHAT IT IS, then pin its boundary.

A hand fix to one boundary (a stutter trimmed out, a clipped onset moved, a false start killed) is
written into the EDL as an explicit start/end plus `"no_refine": true`. Picking the segment by time
alone is what goes wrong: neighbouring segments sit 0.3-0.5 s apart, so a nearest-start match lands
on the wrong one and the fix is applied to an edit nobody meant to touch (your-job 2026-09-18: a pin
meant for a clipped "MP3." onset moved "this in" instead, costing a full author -> splice -> polish
-> pin cycle from clean). So `expect` is REQUIRED here: it refuses instead of picking, and prints
the segment it landed on so the log proves the pin.

Import it from a job's own fix script (both live beside the EDL they repair):

    import importlib.util, json, sys
    from pathlib import Path
    _p = Path(".claude/skills/rough-cut/scripts/pin-boundary.py")
    _s = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("pin_boundary", _p)
    pb = importlib.util.module_from_spec(_s); _s.loader.exec_module(pb)

    edl = json.load(open("/tmp/video-editor/<job>/cuts.json"))
    S = edl["segments"]
    pb.pin(pb.seg(S, "walkthrough.mp4", 656.9, expect="MP3"), start=657.15)
    json.dump(edl, open("/tmp/video-editor/<job>/cuts.json", "w"), indent=1)

Stdlib only. `cut-audit.py`'s "pin_in" / "pin_out" are the AUDIT's pins and a different thing:
`no_refine` pins a boundary against the refiner and the polish, `pin_in` / `pin_out` pin it against
the audit's own re-derivation (rough-cut SKILL.md § Audit the cut on the finish surface's grid).
