face-frame.py — compute the Talking Head Explainer's face framing. Measured, not guessed.

LOCKED framing standard (short-form talking-head explainer, graphics top / face
bottom): in split the median hair top sits 100px below the y960 seam (HAIR_GAP).
WHY 100 and not the old 50: the seam caption's box straddles the seam (y921.5-994.5),
so the head needs clearance under the BOX; 100 leaves about 65px of air under it,
50 left about 15px and the caption sat on the hair. The owner of the number is
presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/layout.md § 2 (its § Values holds the same
HAIR_GAP and FACE_CY_FALLBACK; workflows/test_talking_head_layout.py keeps them equal).
First pass must get this right with zero hand-tuning.

How: sample ~12 frames of the base cut, detect the face (OpenCV YuNet, model
vendored in assets/models/), then find the true hair top with median-background
subtraction (the head moves, the room doesn't — robust against dark hair on a
dark background). Median across frames rides out take-to-take drift.

Usage (top of Graphics, before building anything):
  uv run workflows/face-frame.py projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.mp4
      → prints the #head object-position line, writes projects/<job>/face-frame.json
  uv run workflows/face-frame.py projects/<job>          (or projects/<job>/raw/<clip>)
      → EDL mode, for app lanes where RENDER=0 leaves no base cut: samples the raw ONLY
        inside transcript/cuts.json's kept spans of that clip, spread by kept duration,
        so killed takes never move the median. --edl <cuts.json> names another EDL. A job
        folder measures the clip the EDL keeps the most of and names every other kept clip:
        pass raw/<clip> to measure each of those.
  uv run workflows/face-frame.py --verify <draft-render.mp4>
      → re-measures the composite; must PASS before review (exit 1 on fail)
  uv run workflows/face-frame.py --verify <program.mp4> --plan projects/<job>
      → the same, sampling ONLY the plan's S (split) spans: on a layout-rotation job
        the other layouts frame the face elsewhere by design (layout.md § 2)
  add --annotate out.png to either for an eyeball frame; --out <json> writes the
  result there instead of projects/<job>/face-frame.json

The Talking Head Explainer's extra measurements (EDL mode, one run or several: each
adds its fields to face-frame.json and keeps the others it finds there):
  --modes     writes `modes`, the footage transforms, lane-neutral, in 1080x1920 frame
              fractions ({scale, centre: [x, y]}, scale 1.0 = the untouched wide shot,
              centre = where the source's centre lands):
                W  the wide shot (a 9:16 raw: scale 1.0, centre [0.5, 0.5]; a landscape
                   raw: its face-centred crop)
                S  W's scale, slid so the median hair top lands on y1060 (fallback: the
                   face-box centre on y1385); the chin kept at or above y1620 by giving
                   hair gap first, down to y1020, then (a landscape raw only) by scaling
                   S down in 0.05 steps while the footage covers the bottom half
                T  a face box about 400px tall (scale 400 / the wide face height, never
                   under 1.15x; with a collar, measured now or stored by an earlier
                   --collar run, never so tight the derived tight caption leaves the
                   safe box), the face-box centre on (540, 866)
              layout.md § 2 owns the formulas; lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py reads them.
  --collar    the y where the collar meets the skin on the wide framing: skin calibrated
              on the face's own cheek pixels, the first sustained non-skin row under the
              chin in a neck-wide column; the upper third (by y) of the sampled stills'
              readings that agree with the rest (captions-style.md § 2), with a confidence.
              With --plan projects/<job>: 8 stills over the layout's W, O and T spans only,
              the takes whose caption sits on the collar (a row with its own caption_y is
              left out; without --plan it says so and reads every kept span, S-only takes
              included). Unconfident (a turtleneck, a
              skin-coloured shirt, too few readings) = an annotated sheet next to the json
              and exit 3, UNMEASURED: it never guesses. A collar read after an earlier
              --modes run re-derives the stored modes with it, so T comes out capped as
              one joint run would write it.
  --crown A B the tallest crown (smallest hair-top y, W frame) over timeline span A-B s,
              sampled about every 0.25s through the EDL, into `crowns` (repeatable; an
              overlay card's clearance, layout.md § 9), each stamped with the EDL's
              fingerprint (`edl_sig`): layout.py ignores a crown read through another cut.
              Unmeasurable = exit 3.
  --span A B --modes   the W/S/T transforms fitted to timeline span A-B s ONLY (repeatable), into `span_modes`
              [{start, end, modes, edl_sig}], printed as a layout row's `frame`: a take framed apart from the
              median (the creator stands for the hook, sits after) gets its own fit, pasted into the plan's layout
              rows over that span (layout.md § 12; every lane reads it through layout.footage_spans()). The job's own
              `modes` and face fields are left as they are.
A bare run keeps every field those flags wrote (it re-measures the face only). When the face drifts past
SPREAD_WARN across the samples and splits into two framings, the warning names the EDL spans of the smaller one:
measure those with --span.

Every number below is measured in the 1080x1920 frame the #head shows: a 9:16 source
(any size) only scales onto it ("no reframe needed"), anything else gets the
face-centred reframe crop first.

Fallback when hair can't be measured (hood, hat, detection failure): face-box
center → y1385 (equivalent framing, derived from the same approved reference).
