THE SOURCE OUT IS inPoint + (end - start), IN TICKS. NEVER trackItem.outPoint: after an in-place `clip.end = t`
extend Premiere's outPoint reads STALE forever. On a 2026-09-21 job a +21-frame extend left outPoint 0.876 s short;
that stale value was read as a creator trim, cuts.json and the canonical transcript were rewritten from it, and seven
scenes after it ran 0.876 s early. Every clip whose outPoint disagrees with its own length by more than a frame is
printed as STALE-OUTPOINT: information, never a failure, because this reader does not use it.

Each V1 clip is mapped to the EDL by its MEDIA basename (the replay lays one project item per `clip` basename) and
carries the fields of the old segment whose source span it matches best: the most shared source RELATIVE to the two
spans' union, so a cold-open hook that is a sub-span of a body line, hand-extended, stays the hook (an absolute overlap
mapped it onto the body line, which then read as a split and the hook as deleted), and first a segment no other clip
fits better, so a body line trimmed tight around its hook stays the body line. A boundary more than half a frame
off the EDL (one frame is a real hand move; the replay lands untouched ones on the nearest frame) is the finish
surface's decision: the old pin_*, `beat` (out) and `_refine` side are dropped, the new boundary is stamped `pin_in` /
`pin_out` (rough-cut § a boundary a human decided is pinned for the audit), and the transcript is re-derived from
words.json with polish-boundaries.py's rule: the span keeps every word it PLAYS (inside it, or overlapped by 30 ms or
half the word), so a killed neighbour a boundary grazes never joins the text and a kept word whose aligner end
overshoots a hand OUT does; clips that continue each other in source (a razor split) share those words, each going to
the clip holding its END, else its START. cut-proof holds the laid dialogue to these texts. A clip that shares under
half a frame of source with a segment is a neighbour laid against it, never that segment. `media` / `note` and every
other field are kept. `_timeline` = [start, end] of the clip in sequence seconds (the graphics tools read it).

A MIXED-RATE clip (a source rate other than the sequence's: 24 fps footage on a 23.976 sequence) is judged against
where the replay LANDS each EDL time, never a half-frame window: the replay asks for the first source frame at or above
the nearest sequence frame q (premiere-bridge.mjs replay `land()`), so an untouched in-point reads back on the SOURCE
grid, up to a source frame past q. A half-frame window read 154 false moves on your-job's untouched replay, and
--write would have pinned every one. An untouched side is one whose live value is that landing (q, the source frame S,
or S floored to the sequence grid; an out also as the in's landing plus the replay's laid length), to 10 microseconds
(an out also plus the exact drift a head trim of k source frames carries, k * (1/rate - frame): 41.7 microseconds a
frame at 24 on 23.976, never a tolerance that grows with the trim); a one-frame hand move of either kind is off it. An untouched side of a
mixed-rate clip keeps the EDL's own value, verbatim (its source-grid readback would round to the NEXT sequence frame on a
re-replay); --live-out still carries the live values, where the audio plays. Live (2026-09-23, 24 on 23.976) every
side read S floored to the sequence grid, which is q on a faster source; the source-grid readback is your-job's.
That landing rule is only sound for a FASTER source (its frame shorter than the sequence's), where every landing sits
inside one sequence frame. A SLOWER source (23.976 footage on a 29.97 sequence, 24 on 25) lands up to a whole source
frame past q, so a one-frame hand move can sit ON a landing. There the rule is the one Premiere proved live (2026-09-23,
21/21 clips at 23.976 on 29.97, both sides, to the tick): each side lands on S floored back to the sequence grid, the in
on floor(S_in) and the derived out on floor(S_out), so the V1 length is NOT q_out - q_in (8 of 21 clips were a sequence
frame off it) and an in can read q or S within one timeline. A side is untouched only when it sits on that landing.

Refused, nothing written (exit 2): a subclip laid by `premiere-bridge.mjs lay` ("VID <item> @<in>s": its in-point is
SUBCLIP-relative, and the mapping back to source time is not proven live), a clip with no media file, a clip at a
speed other than 100 % or reversed, a disabled clip, a clip laid from a segment's `media` (a lip-sync render on its own
clock) whose length changed, and a clip whose media neither the EDL (`clip` / `media`) nor words.json names: its
in-point is on that file's own clock (a re-rendered take, an ad's own CTA render, a camera angle over the dialogue),
so it cannot be written as source time.

--write and --live-out also refuse a sequence that is not the job's own (the project holds a sequence named after the
job folder, and this is another one, e.g. its AD clone) unless --edl names the EDL that sequence carries: its cut must
never land in the organic's transcript/cuts.json.

A multi-section job (projects/<job>/sections/<s>/ beside the parent's own EDL) shares ONE V1: the clips of this job's
media must form one contiguous run, and the other sections' clips are left alone.

Exit: 0 read (and written, with --write) · 1 V1 does not add up (a gap, an overlap, or durations that do not sum to the
run) · 2 refused or failed (the job guard, a bridge error, nothing of this job's on V1, or any refusal above), so a
script can tell a timeline that does not add up from a run that never read one.
