#   Windows (native): supported — run from Git Bash (the shell Claude Code uses
#                     on Windows). Panel installs under %APPDATA%, CEP debug

#

# itself; nothing to click), then restart Claude Code once so it picks up
# .mcp.json (answer YES when it asks to enable this project's MCP servers).
