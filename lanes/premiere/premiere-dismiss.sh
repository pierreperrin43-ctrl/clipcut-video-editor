# premiere-dismiss.sh: find and dismiss a native Premiere modal you cannot see.
#
#   ./lanes/premiere/premiere-dismiss.sh            # if a modal is up, post Return to Premiere until it is gone
#   ./lanes/premiere/premiere-dismiss.sh --check    # report only: exit 0 = no modal, 2 = a modal is up
#   ./lanes/premiere/premiere-dismiss.sh --key 53   # post another virtual keycode (53 = Escape) instead of Return (36)
#
# Exit: 0 = no modal (or dismissed), 1 = Premiere not running / tooling failed, 2 = modal still up.
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-02, your-job): with the Mac password-locked, a "project appears to
# be damaged" alert was invisible to every tool, AX saw no windows, menu presses and Cmd+Q posted to
# the process were ignored, `open -a` was ignored, and window-grab captured blank. Three primitives
# worked and were re-invented mid-incident; they live here so nobody invents them a fourth time:
#
#   1. DETECT: `sample <pid> 1 -mayDie` shows a `UI_MessageBox::RunModal` frame while a native alert
#      is up. Zero such frames = no modal. (Nothing else reports it under a locked screen.)
#   2. DISMISS: a bare Return key posted straight to Premiere's pid via CGEvent.postToPid lands on the
#      alert's default button. Session-tap posts and AX presses do not.
#   3. OPEN: once DETECT reports zero, an AppleEvent opens a project where `open -a` and AX are ignored:
#      osascript -e 'tell application "Adobe Premiere Pro 2026" to open POSIX file "<path>"'
#      (not scripted here: it is the one open allowed once the hard gate below is clear).
#
# The hard gate that goes with it (lanes/premiere/premiere-grading.md § 2): after ANY refused open, no
# second open until this reports zero. Five opens queued behind one modal wedged Premiere until it
# could not quit by any means. One failed open is data; five is a wedge.
