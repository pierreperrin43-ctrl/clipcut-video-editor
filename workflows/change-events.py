"""change-events.py: the frames where a picture visibly changes, and whether they land on the words they were timed to.

  uv run workflows/change-events.py <video> [--region x,y,w,h] [--alpha] [--threshold 2] [--min-gap-frames 3] [--json out]
  uv run workflows/change-events.py --sync projects/<job> [ids...] [--tolerance 0.10] [--region ...] [--threshold ...] [--json out]

DETECT prints every change event in a render or a capture (a message typed, sent, a reply landing, a card popping):
its onset frame, its time (the frame's own pts, so a variable-rate screen recording is timed right), its peak
magnitude and, with --alpha, whether ink APPEARED or DISAPPEARED. The magnitude is the per-frame mean absolute
difference (0-255) over the region's pixels that the file ever covers (the whole region for an opaque file, only
the drawn part of an overlay, so a top-half card measures the same as the same card cropped), on a copy at most
360 px wide: gray composited over black by default, the alpha channel with --alpha. Each frame is judged by how far
it rises above the local motion floor (the 25th percentile of the 12 frames before it), so a render that drifts,
pushes in or scrolls the whole time still shows its cuts and landings. An event opens on a frame that rises
--threshold above that floor and stays open until one rises less than half of it (hysteresis: one animation is one
event); two bursts with fewer than --min-gap-frames quiet frames between them are one event. The magnitude printed
is the event's raw peak. --alpha treats the frame before the file as empty,
because an overlay lands on the timeline at its frame 0: ink already there on frame 0 is an event at frame 0.
The noise line (median and 95th percentile of the per-frame magnitude) is what to read before moving --threshold
for a small region or a noisy capture. --region is in the file's own pixels.

SYNC checks each placed graphic (hf-graphics/placement.json) against the words it was timed to. A plan cell names
its anchors in graphics-plan.json:
    "sync": [{"word": "sent"}, {"word": "retention", "offset": 0.25}, {"word": "add", "expect": "first change"}]
  word    a word or a phrase, matched whole-word (case and edge punctuation ignored) among the words spoken while
          the row is on screen (its placed span, widened by the tolerance); "nth": 2 takes the 2nd of several
          (a whole number from 1; anything else is a BAD ANCHOR, never an index)
  expect  "change" (default): the nearest change event · "first change": the render's first one (its entrance)
  offset  a DESIGNED lag in seconds (a reply that lands 0.25 s after its word; a lead is negative); default 0, or on
          the kit's clock the "sync_offset" recorded on the kit row it meets (below)
  source  "kit" or "render": which clock the anchor is checked on (below). Default: "kit" on a kit cell, "render" on a
          capture or montage and for every "first change"; any other value is a BAD ANCHOR
A cell with no "sync" falls back to its START WORD when its start is on a word (a word starts within the tolerance
of it): that word must meet the render's first change. A "first change" (the fallback or named) is read on the
render's pixels on every cell unless its anchor says "source": "kit": it is the render's ENTRANCE, and a kit comp's
entrance can make no sound, so its first kit row is not its entrance.
A KIT cell, family "authored" or "overlay" (what a preset kit's components build: the Talking Head Explainer's hook,
escalation, CTAs and call card) with rows of its id in hf-graphics/sfx-hand.json marked "src": "kit", is checked on
those KIT events: each row is a beat the component placed on the comp's own clock (the value keyed in, a badge
landing, a window stacking, the accept tapped), the timeline the render is drawn from. A RUN of one sound is ONE event
at its first row, as one animation is one event below, so an anchor meets the run's onset, never a row inside it.
Runs are read in SECONDS, the same at every frame rate: consecutive rows of the same event each within 0.17 s of the
one before (a fast burst, 3 to 4 f apart on the 23.976 grid: a pop-run), and every row of the same event after a row
carrying "sync_offset", up to a row of another event, whatever the gap (the gesture that designed lead opens:
masked_value's taps, 0.11 to 0.2 s apart by the value's digit count). "sync_offset" is a DESIGNED offset from its word
that the component recorded (masked_value's key lead, shorter when its pill lands late): an anchor with no "offset"
READS it off the row (each kit event is sought where its own recorded offset puts it), so the plan need not repeat
it and the lead is applied exactly, never absorbed by the tolerance; an anchor that declares a DIFFERENT "offset" FAILS
naming the row's, because the plan and the comp disagree about what was built.
Pixel differencing cannot separate them there (small dots merge with a pill's rise, a scene that scrolls or a waveform
that moves the whole time is one long event), so the render's changes are printed for reference and the anchors are
held to the kit's events. "source": "render" on an anchor forces the pixel check; "source": "kit" forces the kit's rows
on any family (a capture's cut-in) and is NOT CHECKED when the id has no kit rows, never quietly measured on pixels.
A kit row is held to what the timeline shows exactly as a change is (below): a beat at or after the out-point is
never matched. The render must still exist and decode: a kit cell with a missing render is not checked (the kit's
rows are read from sfx-hand.json, so a comp rebuilt and not re-rendered is not caught here).
The word's time comes from the canonical outputs/<job>.transcript.json and is mapped into the render's own clock
through the row's start. Events are detected on what the render adds to the timeline (gray over black or alpha, whichever changed more, with the frame
before the file empty, so a render's entrance is an event), and only those the timeline SHOWS count: the placer lays
a render from its frame 0 and trims one that runs longer than its slot at the row's end, so a change whose onset is
at or after the out-point is never seen and is neither listed nor matched. Each anchor prints its delta to the expected event;
beyond --tolerance it FAILS. A word not spoken in the row's span, or spoken there more than once with no "nth", is
REPORTED with where it is spoken, never guessed.

Exit: detect 0, or 2 on unreadable input. Sync 0 = every anchor within tolerance, 1 = any FAIL, 2 = no FAIL but an
anchor could not be checked (unknown or ambiguous word, bad anchor, missing render, "source": "kit" with no kit rows)
or nothing was checked.

Why (2026-09-21): six scenes were timed to a transcript that ran 0.876 s early, and every check passed them
(framing, sweeps, cut frames), because none compared picture to words; a job-local sync script found it. Capture
shots were timed with a job-local tblend/signalstats shell one-liner that broke under zsh, and SFX cues were
re-timed three times by hand-run frame differencing. This is that measurement, once, for every job.
