"""graphics-qa.py: the build-time QA gate between the graphics BUILD (5b) and the REVIEW loop (5c).

  uv run workflows/graphics-qa.py projects/<job> [--ids g1,g2] [--json hf-graphics/qa-report.json] [--fps 24000/1001]
  (uv resolves numpy from the header; plain python3 works where numpy is installed; --selftest lints two fixtures offline)

Exit 1 on any FAIL: the handoff to edit-review is blocked until it is green. Everything it owns is
OFF-LIMITS to the LLM reviewers, they review intent, copy and depiction; this sweeps every frame.

Why: most review-round defects are deterministic, so this sweeps them in seconds instead of burning
review rounds on them. Long-form 16:9 only — the geometry is authored at 1920x1080 and a 4K render of the same design (3840x2160,
the 1080 layout on a `scale(2)` stage, never `#root{zoom:2}`, 2026-09-07) is measured in that frame by scaling the planes down, so it refuses
any other frame size rather than hand back a false green.

Inputs (all in the job folder): hf-graphics/placement.json (the placement manifest, one row per placed
graphic: {id, file, start, end, kind: text|full|overlay, track}; `uv run workflows/placement.py <job> --write`
writes it on any lane, and the Premiere lane's place-graphics.py --plan --write is the same derivation),
graphics-plan.json, transcript/cuts.json (V1 cut points = cumulative kept durations), the comps under
hf-graphics/*/compositions/, the renders those rows point at, and hf-graphics/qa-waivers.json:
  {"g18": {"band": "its lowest bounce frame sits ON y1030 by design"}, "g16": {"source:overshoot": "the chip sits BEHIND the node"}}
A waiver replaces a prose "deliberate deviation" in the build report: machine-read, named per check (or
per `check:tag`, the narrower key a tagged FAIL answers to first), shown in the report as `waived`, so a
reviewer cannot dismiss a real defect on a sentence (round 2 dismissed a real 83 ms cut-end flash that way).
A waiver silences a FAIL **or a warn**; `info` is never waived. A deviation the build justified once is
recorded once: before 2026-09-19 a waiver only answered a FAIL, so every warn-level deviation was
re-adjudicated from scratch by every review round (11 dead entries in one job's waiver file).

Checks (per placed graphic unless noted):
  render     file exists · overlay = ProRes 4444 alpha, full-screen = opaque mp4 · fps == the timeline's
  duration   placed length vs the render's, within 1.5 frames (a trim means an exit was cut off); a STEPPED
             render (bg-dark, STEP_FPS=12) may sit up to one step (2 frames) long — render.sh's `fps=` expansion
             pads it and the placer trims it back to the authored span by design
  parity     a placed render that has a sibling VERSION at another resolution (g6-k.mp4 at 4K beside g6.mp4 at 1080)
             must be the same picture: workflows/render-diff.py against the newest such sibling (2026-09-07: three
             4K punch-cuts shipped 77x43 px off-centre under `#root{zoom:2}`, reported pixel-identical, unmeasured)
  band       overlays: no ink below the band floor (y1030), none within 80 px of the left/right edge (100 top),
             low-band graphics never above the band top, EVERY frame of the render (alpha sweep)
  face       side callouts (region callout-L/R): on every hold frame the ink stays 60 px off the head, ears
             included, as measured per window by chin-line.py --edl and carried in the plan cell as `head`
             (2026-09-10: g7, g12, g30 sat on his ear for a whole shipped video, the zone was picked, never measured)
  exit       overlays: the last rendered frame is EMPTY (hard-kill) unless the V1 cut is the exit
  lead       full-screens: static lead frames before the first element arrives (frame-0 rule)
  grain      full-screens carry the film-grain pass (section titles are exempt), measured off the pixels that
             are not clipped at black (a near-black window clips half the luma noise and read 0.82 with the pass on)
             and on the first LIT frame of its opening 3 s, never frame 0 alone (one that opens on black — a
             fade-in, a dark scene's first beat — is measured where it has picture instead of abstaining)
  dynamics   full-screens: share of its life that sits still on the 12 fps grid (warn over 60 %) + the count of big visual beats
  rack       full-screens: when the centre darkens (a rack focus) the frame edges darken with it, else the racked
             layer sits inside the scaled content. Read on the frame where the EDGES are darkest — the dim layer's
             own settled state — since the recipe lands bright type dead centre over the racked scene. A declared
             #racked with no dim at all WARNS on either field: on a dark one that can also be a correct blur-ladder
             rack, so a wired rack there is a `rack` waiver, but the question is always asked
  centre     full-screens: on the fullest frame the whole composed box centres within 40 px horizontally (FAIL) and every ink
             ROW (words + the prop beside them are ONE row) within 40 px — FAIL on a text punch-cut, warn on a scene (a window's
             title bar, the chip row under one side of a diagram); the vertical box centre warns (2026-09-13: g5's words were
             centred, the props beside them hung off the right end, two rows 100/116 px right); a deliberate deviation waives
             `centre:row` / `centre:box`
             (lead and the centre ROWS do not run on FOOTAGE — a capture or a generated b-roll clip has no authored
             entrance and no centred type, the way grain exempts a section title. `dynamics` is exempt on a REAL
             capture only — a recorded file, by kind or by the `capture`/captures asset it names — because a
             screen recording's motion is the app's, while a generated clip that sits still is a finding)
  cut      a full-screen (or a text animation whose exit is the cut) that ends within 8 frames of a V1 cut
             must end ON it, EXACTLY: a frame above flashes the outgoing shot, a hair below floors to the
             tick and lands short; ending far from any cut (a cut back mid-take, g14) is a choice and passes
  holes      overlays on one track: overlaps (FAIL) and sub-3-frame gaps between neighbours (warn). Measured
             PER TRACK, always: two graphics that overlap on DIFFERENT tracks are a hard-cut exit, the
             reviewer's to read on the render, never a gate finding
  plan       every plan graphic is placed and vice versa; start/end agree within 1.5 frames
  hero       a cell with "hero_frame" (a still of the creator CAST by workflows/hero-frame.py --pick): the comp's <img> is that file
  copy       text-animation phrase == the plan's copy · no U+2014 in any on-screen copy
  source     hand comps: helpers defined or hf-anim.js loaded · registry constants exact · riseOut relative · pop() never on type ·
             float() on a wrapper over 0 → DUR · 12 fps form on bg-dark · no flash at 12 fps · no Math.random /
             onUpdate · no CSS filter-string tween · content reveals pin the zero frame · arrowheads computed ·
             position:absolute with no offsets · a pop's overshoot clears its neighbours · exits never before entrances ·
             an element parked outside an overflow:hidden ancestor (clip) · an opacity:0 element no script ever
             touches (unlit) · rows split across source lines under white-space:pre (pre-rows) · an overlay box
             whose registry TRAVEL leaves the band or the edge margin (clearance)
  density    (job) events/min, longest bare stretch, full-screen share + rate + SPREAD (≤ 40 s without one), same field twice
             in a row — all of it over the plan's `graphics_scope` ranges when it has them, else the whole runtime
Not here (the reviewers own them): copy meaning, depiction (card vs scene), asset contrast on its plate,
glow spill outside a prop's box, reveal burst cadence on the render.
