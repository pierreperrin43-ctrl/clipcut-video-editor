"""cut-proof.py: the production gate for a laid rough cut. Bounce the section's dialogue off the LIVE
timeline, transcribe the bounce independently, and diff it word by word against the script the EDL
promised. A chopped syllable ("a 50" for "a 53"), a doubled word at a joint or a missing word shows
up as a substitution / insertion / deletion with its timeline position; nothing else does.

        # bounces [from, to) of the ACTIVE sequence (other audio tracks muted for the take), writes
        # <job>/review/cut-proof.wav + cut-proof.json, prints the diff and exits 1 on any defect;
        # --from defaults to the EDL's first frame on the timeline, --to to the EDL's last frame (the sequence end
        # when that is within half a second: the same cut, off by the grid), so a middle section bounces alone
  uv run lanes/premiere/cut-proof.py projects/<job>[/sections/<s>] --wav <existing.wav> [--from <t>]
        # re-diff an existing bounce (--from = where that bounce started on the timeline)
  uv run lanes/premiere/cut-proof.py projects/<job> --from 300 --to 360 --triage
        # prove ONE window: the script is cut to the segments the bounce covers, and every defect
        # gets its own ±1.5 s slice re-transcribed underneath it
  uv run lanes/premiere/cut-proof.py projects/<job> --check-text
        # offline, no bounce: every EDL segment's `transcript` against the words words.json places in it

A triaged ASR false positive (a reduced "with" every engine hears as "for", the raw included) is accepted in
<job>/review/cut-proof.accepted.json, a list of {script, heard, t, cut_rev, reason}: a defect with the same script
and heard words within ±0.5 s of `t` (timeline seconds, as printed) on the same `cut_rev` (the first 12 of sha1 over
the EDL, printed in the summary) is reported `accepted` and does not fail the gate. `reason` is required, and a row
from another cut_rev is ignored (named), so a re-cut re-opens every accepted defect.

Before the bounce every segment's `transcript` is checked against words.json: text that omits a word wholly inside
the segment, or carries one the segment does not hold, is a false DEFECT waiting to happen (two segments on the
Windows proof, 2026-09-27), so it is named first.

Where the EDL's first frame sits on the timeline (--edl-start) is read from the job when not passed: the
EDL's own `_timeline` readback, else a section's graphics-plan.json `timeline_offset`, else 0 for a
top-level projects/<job>. Only when none applies does it fall back to --from, with a ⚠. The window the
script is cut to is printed on every run.

The EDL's `transcript` fields are the promise (rough-cut writes them from the kept WhisperX words);
the bounce is transcribed with mlx-whisper (word timestamps) and both sides are normalised (lower,
alphanumerics only, common number words to digits, then the repo's spelling map) before a difflib
alignment. Small ASR noise (a/the, contractions, a brand the two engines spell differently) is
reported but tagged `minor`; a changed or missing content word is `DEFECT`.
Runs after the replay + audio polish; re-run after any hand edit.
