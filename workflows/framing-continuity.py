"""framing-continuity.py: catch a framing jump at a cut, the background moving or scaling between the last frame
before a cut and the first frame after it.

  uv run workflows/framing-continuity.py <export.mp4> --cuts projects/<job>/transcript/cuts.json
  uv run workflows/framing-continuity.py <export.mp4> --cuts 127.169,131.02 [--patch x,y,w,h ...] [--max-px 4]

  --cuts C          an EDL (its `_timeline` readback when every segment carries one, else the cumulative kept
                    durations) or cut times in seconds, comma- or space-separated
  --offset S        seconds subtracted from every cut time: where the export's first frame sits on the cut clock
                    (default 0, an export of the whole sequence)
  --patch x,y,w,h   measure on these patches (export pixels) instead of the ring; repeatable. You vouch they
                    are bare background, so any one of them that moves FAILs the cut
  --max-px N        the largest background move a cut may carry, in export pixels (default 4)
  --max-scale F     the largest scale change a cut may carry (default 0.01 = 1%)
  --quiet           one line per cut (it still names the patches it measured on)

At each cut the last frame before it and the first frame after it are decoded frame-exact, with the two frames
beside each (three per side). The move is measured on BACKGROUND patches: a ring of 12 round the frame's border
(corners and edges, never the centre, where the speaker is). A patch counts only when it has detail on both sides
of the cut (a flat wall or a ceiling's shading matches itself at any shift), holds still inside each side (a patch
that changes within three frames is a moving speaker, an animating graphic or a camera move), and still matches
itself once the shift is taken out (correlation of the detail after alignment). The shift is phase correlation
(numpy FFT, sub-pixel); the scale comes from how the moves vary across the frame, because a zoom moves every patch
away from its centre in proportion to the distance: d = (s - 1)(p - centre) + t.

THE PATCHES MEASURE THE COMPOSITE, so a HOLD PROVES NOTHING ON ITS OWN. A graphic that spans the cut is the same on
both sides: a patch under it reads 0 px however far the footage behind it moved (a hand-picked patch did exactly
that on the incident below, and on that frame two of the ring's patches sit under a card). So holds never outvote a
move: two or more patches that moved together (the same shift, or for three or more one zoom + shift, each within
2 px) FAIL the cut however many held. One patch that moved alone is read on the RING of footage round it (half a
patch wide, the patch left out), tile by tile:
  - most of the ring's tiles move with it and none holds: the jump is the framing, the patches that held are under
    a graphic, and the cut FAILs;
  - 4 or more tiles move with it and some hold: an object bigger than the patch (a shoulder, a chair back, a panel
    scrolling in a screen recording) and the framing seen through a gap in a graphic look the same from the
    composite, so the cut is UNMEASURED (exit 2), never a pass. Look at it, or re-run with --patch on bare
    background away from the mover. On real talking-head shorts a shoulder crossing a bottom patch does this;
  - fewer tiles move (the mover stays inside its patch, a hand, a waveform's bars), or the ring is flat: it is local
    motion, named under the verdict and not failed.
THE ONE CASE LEFT TO THE EYE: footage that shows through a gap in a graphic no wider than about a tenth of a patch
round the patch looks exactly like something moving inside the patch, and is only named. Read any "moved alone"
line. Every patch's box and read is printed. The cleanest input is a draft exported with the graphics tracks off.

Exit 0 = every cut PASS. Exit 1 = a cut FAILs: patches moved together more than --max-px (or any one --patch
patch did, or one patch did with the footage round it), or the patches that held fit a scale change beyond
--max-scale. Exit 2 = unreadable input, or a cut UNMEASURED: no patch passed the gates, every counted patch moved
and no two agree, or a lone mover took part of the footage round it along. A deliberate reframe (split to full frame, a punch-in, a full-screen
graphic) reads UNMEASURED, and so does a jump wider than about a third of a patch (90 px on a 1080-wide frame): the
patches stop matching. Neither is ever reported as a pass.

Calibrated on a shipped short's 47 real cuts (two exports of the same talking-head job, graphics and captions on):
0 false fails, the background patches reading 0.0-0.3 px. The frames either side of the incident's cut read 32.9 px
on four agreeing patches while two patches under a card held at 0.0. A second short that reframes on purpose at
most cuts (split to full frame, punch-ins) read 9 PASS, 12 UNMEASURED, 0 FAIL: run it there on the cuts either side
of the substituted clip (--cuts <in>,<out>).

Why this exists (2026-09-22/23): a short's ad CTA was laid from a lip-sync clip generated on a 9:16 crop that sat
36 source px right of the timeline's framing, so the static wall jumped 33 px sideways at the cut. It shipped to
review twice, the second time because the 4K re-sync that fixed it was rendered and never laid. A four-frame look
called the framing fine both times; the creator caught it on playback. Run this on a draft export after laying any
substituted clip (a lip-sync render, a re-take, a re-rendered segment).
