  --plan <file>     the cut sheet, relative to the job (default hf-graphics/sfx-plan.json; an AD cut's is its own file)
  --sequence NAME   refuse unless the active sequence is NAME: the job guard (VE_SEQUENCE) and every read and write here
  --until T         the COPY WINDOW, for --adopt, --apply, --verify, --remove-extra and --diff: only rows and clips starting
                    before T seconds, and inside it EVERY clip on the SFX tracks counts, whatever folder it came from, so a
                    copy is exact (--remove-extra also takes a clip that sits on its row but fails --verify's level, slice
                    or tail line, for --apply to lay again); a cue before T that rings past it is held to, and laid
                    only up to, the sequence's OWN next cue at or after T on its track, which the window never touches
  --dry             with --remove / --remove-extra: list the clips that would go, touch nothing; with --adopt: print
                    what it would keep, change, add and drop, write nothing (any other command refuses it, as it
                    refuses an unknown flag or a value no flag takes, before it talks to Premiere)

--adopt reads every clip on the SFX tracks (every audio track but A1, the voice, and A5, the music) from any
folder and writes one row per clip: the id, gid and event of the plan row it matches (same file and track, `at`
within 1.5 frames), else a new h-id on the nearest placed graphic with event "hand". The source out is the
in-point plus the laid length, never Premiere's outPoint (stale after a clip.end write). It prints what it kept,
changed, added and dropped; an empty readback never empties a plan.

Copy the creator-tuned SFX of one sequence onto a variant of it (an AD cut). T is the FIRST FRAME where the two
sequences differ, in picture OR in SFX, and it sits at or before the target's own first cue: a lead-in whoosh laid a
frame or two before the target's own cut is the target's, so T goes before it, never on the cut after it (inside the
window that whoosh is foreign to the copy and --remove-extra takes it; the dry list marks a foreign clip that runs
past T as "the target's own lead-in?"). Read T off the sequence grid, in seconds:
  1. the source active:  --sequence "<job>" --adopt --plan hf-graphics/sfx-plan.ad.json --until T
  2. --sequence "<job> AD" --plan hf-graphics/sfx-plan.ad.json --remove-extra --dry     (read the list)
  3. the same without --dry, then the same with --apply, then with --verify
--adopt --until RECORDS the window in the plan's .meta.json, and every later command on that plan holds it: typed
again or left out, it is the same window; another T is refused (only --adopt moves it), and so is the bare full clear.
--adopt --until none clears it (the whole sequence adopted, no window recorded). The window is a VARIANT's: --adopt
refuses one on the job's own hf-graphics/sfx-plan.json (a --plan left out of step 1), which is the whole sequence.

--apply, --verify, --diff and --adopt first say when the plan was derived from an older placement.json (a graphic
moved since, so its cues sit where it used to be), naming the moved graphics; a graphic that moved together with its
cues (a re-cut, workflows/ripple-cut.py) is not stale. The record is the plan's `<plan>.meta.json`, written by
workflows/sfx-plan.py (its --record for a plan it did not write) and by --adopt.

The plan is universal (workflows/sfx-plan.py); this is the HOW for Premiere. Rows carry
{at, file, src_in, src_out, level_db, track}. Mechanics, all read back before they are believed:

  - the library file is imported ONCE into an `sfx` bin (found by media path on later runs)
  - audio tracks are provisioned with QE addTracks so the plan's track index exists (appends, so
    nothing already placed moves)
  - each slice is placed by setting the project item's in/out and DOM overwriteClip at
    at + 1e-4 (the replay's floor-nudge), then the in/out are cleared again — and the clip's
    in-point is WRITTEN BACK, because overwriteClip floors it to the sequence grid (up to a
    frame of phantom source drift), then read back before it is believed — a write-back that
    does not hold fails the run at the END, naming every affected row, never mid-batch
  - the level is the clip's intrinsic Volume > Level, through `clip_level.lvl_v` — the encoding's
    ONE code home; its prose home is lanes/premiere/lab-notes.md, and neither is restated here
