"""validate-plan.py: the hard gate at graphics-plan Step 5: a plan that fails here is not PRESENTED.

  uv run .claude/skills/graphics-plan/scripts/validate-plan.py projects/<job> [--fps 24000/1001]
  uv run .claude/skills/graphics-plan/scripts/validate-plan.py projects/<job> --check   # read-only: stamp nothing

Exit 1 on any FAIL. A PASS also STAMPS the plan with `cut_rev`, the EDL it is valid against
(§ stamp_cut_rev): that stamp is what `lanes/premiere/place-graphics.py` refuses on when the cut has
moved under the plan, and what `workflows/ripple-cut.py` re-writes when it re-times one. Checks (2026-09-02, from the your-job retro, every one is a defect
the build or the review loop later paid for):
  anchor    a text-animation cell STARTS on the first word of its own copy (word.start − 0.08 lead,
            within 0.15s): not on the sentence, not on a guess (g18b, g6). A contraction anchors it and
            warns ("that" against a spoken "that's"); nothing at all prints what IS spoken there.
            A full-screen cut-in that leads no spoken word and sits on no V1 cut WARNS (the reviewer's
            call, not the gate's), and `"anchor": "none"` + the reason in content answers it
  cut       a full-screen / punch-cut edge within 8 frames of a cuts.json boundary sits ON it to the
            frame, exactly: a rounded end flashes the outgoing shot (g2 83 ms, g11 42 ms, g7 25 ms),
            and Premiere floors seconds to ticks, so an end written 16.783 for the cut at 16.78343
            lands the pin a frame early; an edge far from any cut is a cut back mid-take and passes
  readable  a cell flagged "readable": true (prompt, command, code, config, quote) holds ≥ 3.0s
            (a 2s hold of the complete content plus its reveal; the Talking Head Explainer's own hold is under
            `layout` below) and, unless it is a captured file,
            names the source_artifact it is copied from; quote/comment kinds without the
            flag are asked about
  copy      exact written source when source_artifact is set; otherwise no em dash, text animations lowercase-casual (a leading capital that is not a
            proper noun is asked about), copy present on every graphic:true cell (a declared "copy": "" is a
            graphic with no words, and passes silently on any kind but a text animation)
  shape     ids unique, start < end, kind/template/region/content present; two cells in the SAME region may
            never overlap in time (one slot, one graphic — g24 and g25 both took the low band and the
            second clamped the first mid-shot), a cross-region overlap warns; an overlap counts only past half
            a frame (a butt-join at a cut touches to a float's width and is not one)
  fit       the two template caps the plan can be held to, both WARNS: a list card is an eyebrow + max 3 rows,
            and a side callout carrying a capture/screenshot/hero frame declares a `crop` — a crop that IS
            written and fills under half its slot is the one FAIL here, because that one is measured
  capture   a screen-rec / screenshot cell carries "asset" (a file already in the job folder, at
            assets/captures/<id>.<ext>) or "capture" {source, target, action, seconds | still}: the build
            records it, never guesses (graphics-plan § THE CAPTURE GATE, 2026-09-11). It is asked (warn) for what
            it must SHOW ("shows"), and a capture that scrolls carries no annotation pinned to its content
            (2026-09-19: a spinner shipped as the evidence, a circle drifted off its button as the page scrolled)
  hero      a still of the creator inside a graphic is CAST by workflows/hero-frame.py, never grabbed (2026-09-13, a
            hook shipped the beat's plan-frame: mid-word, eyes half shut): no cell names a plan-frames/ file; a cell
            that shows a real frame of the video carries "hero_frame" {t, file}; the pick proof
            review/hero-frames/<id>.pick.json exists, passed, and matches (graphics-plan § THE HERO-FRAME GATE)
  density   the per-minute block printed against creative-moves.md § THE DENSITY NUMBERS, measured over the
            plan's `graphics_scope` ranges when it has them: a stretch the creator bars graphics from is not
            a density hole (12 minutes of walkthrough produced four permanent unsatisfiable warns otherwise).
            Those are LONG-FORM numbers: on a short-form plan the block is printed and nothing is gated on it

  layout    the Talking Head Explainer (the plan's `preset` or `format` names talking-head-explainer): its layout map
            is gated by presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/layout.py, imported by path and run as its own
            report (the span table, the shares against the benchmark, the rule table, the findings), then once more
            per `variants.<name>` (the ad's own layout tail). Its FAIL rules fail this plan, its WARNs are answered in
            the plan summary, and a missing input it names (face-frame.json `modes`, the transcript) fails the plan
            until it is supplied (layout.md § 13). On this preset `region` and `content` are not required (the
            layout map places every graphic) and a readable cell's hold is its own graphics.md § 13 WARN (about 2 s
            once whole), never the long-form 3.0 s FAIL

A gate here FAILS only what is a defect on its own terms. A field the plan simply has not written down is a
warn: five shipped, creator-approved plans predate half of these, and a gate that fails approved work stops
being read (2026-09-19).
