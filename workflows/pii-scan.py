    --needle S        a literal matched through its DIGITS (repeatable); one with no digits at all is swept as a --phrase
    --phrase S        words that must not show (repeatable): case-insensitive, whitespace and punctuation normalised,
                      matched from the START of a word with its end free, so a stem catches every ending ('cancell' hits
                      cancelled and cancelling) while 'sign in' still misses 'design in'. Read against each OCR block AND
                      a frame's blocks joined in reading order and down each column (a line that wraps into the next
                      block still matches, beside a sidebar too); the hit boxes are the blocks carrying its tokens
    --any-number N    flag any block holding a phone-shaped run of >= N digits (groups joined by spaces, dashes, dots or
                      parens or underscores, spaced or not; inside a file name when a separator fences the digits:
                      555-0100-1234.txt, lead_555-0100-1234.txt, call-2026-09-23-555-0100-1234.mp3), clocks, dates,
                      UUIDs and camera date-times excluded; digits glued to letters on BOTH sides (x5550100x) are not
                      counted: the sweep for a number nobody can name in advance
    --pii <file>      the target file (default <job>/pii.json): a JSON list of needles, or {"needles": [...],
                      "phrases": [...], "any_number": N}; any file not ending .json is phrases, one per line (# comments)
    --still PNG ...   OCR these stills instead of a video (job optional, put it FIRST); prints every hit, writes nothing
    --raw <file>      the video to sweep (default: the first video under raw/). Any video works — a screen-record take or
                      an exported draft — with --all, because the EDL's kept spans describe the raw and nothing else
    --all             scan the whole video; default scans ONLY the EDL's kept spans (transcript/cuts.json)
    --coarse N        coarse sample rate in frames per second (default 2)
    --seed-run N      digits of a needle a COARSE frame must show to open a window (default 7, capped at the needle's length)
    --min-run N       digits a frame INSIDE an open window must show to count (default 4)
    --ocr-width N     OCR at this width, boxes scaled back to source pixels (default 1920; 0 = native)
    --block N         frames a window grows by per step (default: the coarse step)
    --batch N         frames per OCR batch (default 64)
    --out <path>      hit map (default <job>/review/pii-scan.json for the job's own raw, the file place-blur.py reads;
                      review/pii-scan-<stem>.json for any video outside raw/, so sweeping a take or a draft never
                      replaces the raw's confirmed map). The sheet sits beside it, named for it: pii-hits[-<stem>]/
    --no-sheet        skip the contact sheet

Exit 0 = clean sweep. Exit 1 = something was found (the boxes still have to be blurred and the sweep re-run clean).
Exit 2 = --still could not vouch for a still (missing, undecodable, or Vision read NO text on it: a blank grab is not a
clean one), there was nothing to look for, or the video is missing. Exit 3 = the OCR could not sweep: the shim did not
run, or it could not read a frame of the sweep (an unread frame is never a clean one, so there is no verdict).

"Clean" means Vision READ nothing, never that nothing is there. A phone held up to the camera read 0 digits in 14 OCR
variants on 2026-09-21, and frame stacking recovered part of the number the next day: defocused or small text on a
camera-held screen is checked by eye, whatever this sweep says.

Why this exists (2026-09-19): a 52-minute 4K screen recording had two phone numbers on screen, and the ad-hoc sweep that
found them was rewritten twice for speed and twice for false hits — a full-resolution OCR of every frame of the RAW, a
window growth that re-read frames it had already read, and a digit-shape matcher that flagged a call UUID, a token count
and a clock. Four things that cost that time are the four things this tool does:

  1. It scans the CUT, not the raw. kept_spans() is hero-frame.py's, verbatim: a 52-minute source is 13 minutes of ship.
  2. It OCRs DOWNSCALED frames. Vision reads a 1920-wide frame in ~0.1 s and a 4K one in ~1.0 s, with the same hits;
     the boxes are scaled back to source pixels so a blur placer still gets real coordinates.
  3. It reads every frame at most ONCE (`self.boxes` is the memo, `scanned` is the covered set), so growing a window
     outward costs the new frames only.
  4. Needles are LITERAL. A seed needs --seed-run digits of the needle in a row (7 is ~1-in-10-million per text block);
     only INSIDE an open window does the looser --min-run apply, because a partial read there ("555-1", "3324" as the
     number is typed or scrolls off) is a real leak. Even there a short run is not enough on its own: the fragment
     has to be nothing but a piece of the needle, or a clock walks straight back in — one did, on the first version
     of this tool: "Fri Sep 18 4:37 PM" reads as 18437, and a ten-digit number easily contains 1843 somewhere.

Words and unknown numbers (2026-09-21): every first-round capture of a live-app job showed text that must not ship — a
churn figure, and the session's own staging prompts typed into the app — and none of it had a digit run to match, so
two job-local word sweeps were written beside this tool. --phrase and --any-number are those sweeps, and --still is the
pre-take gate screen-record.sh --preflight runs on a window grab so a tainted take never rolls.

Every example in this file is a made-up 555 number, deliberately: a tool whose whole job is keeping a real string off
the screen does not carry one in its own source, and this file ships in the client package.

THE OUTPUT IS A CONTRACT with whatever blurs the boxes, so it is written in the shape a blur placer already eats:

    review/pii-scan.json       {"<source frame>": [[x0, y0, x1, y1, "the text that box carried"], …], …}

  · the key is the SOURCE frame index as a decimal string (frame 0 is the raw's first frame, no padding), and the
    frame number is what maps a hit onto a timeline — a placer reads its own clip in/out points and converts.
  · the box is four integers in SOURCE pixels — left, top, right, bottom, origin TOP-LEFT — whatever --ocr-width
    the sweep actually ran at; the fragment is the OCR text, kept so a hit can be judged without re-reading a frame.
  · EVERY frame the sweep read is a key, so a frame with an empty list means "read, nothing on it" — a placer drops
    those (`if v`) and interpolates short dropouts itself. A frame that was never read is simply absent: absence is
    not evidence, which is why the meta file records what the sweep covered.

    review/pii-scan.meta.json  the sweep itself: raw, needles, kept_only, fps, source size, ocr_width, seed/min run,
                               frames_read, hit_frames, and each window's frames, seconds and fragments.

Plus review/pii-hits/, a still per window with the boxes drawn on it. The hits are confirmed BY EYE off that sheet
before anything is blurred: same RANK-don't-choose discipline as hero-frame.py. macOS Vision does the OCR through an
inline Swift shim (the pattern workflows/window-grab.sh uses); it is compiled once per run, because
`swift file.swift` re-compiles on every call.
