The house chain is static: +GAIN dB into a hard limiter at -6 dBFS, never dynamic. The limiter is
FIXED; the gain is whatever puts the raw's kept speech on the house target, so a quiet shoot and a
hot shoot both land in the same place:

    TARGET = -17 LUFS integrated, pre-limiter    ->    gain = round(TARGET - measured)

Measured on the KEPT ranges only (transcript/cuts.json against raw/), never the whole take: dead air
and the slate would drag the integrated number down and over-gain the speech. ffmpeg 8.0.x's aselect keeps
everything, so there the ranges are cut out by atrim + concat instead (keep(), aselect_works()).

A MONO raw is measured as DUAL MONO (ebur128 dualmono): the level it plays at on both channels of a stereo
master, so a mono raw and its stereo twin get the same gain. Measured as one channel it read 3 LU under its twin
and took 3 dB more gain (live 2026-09-24: the same mix bounced -13.5 LUFS as a mono clip, -16.4 as stereo). How a
lane plays a mono clip at that level is the lane's business (Premiere: audio-polish.py gives its -3 dB centre pan
law back).

Where the target comes from and how each lane applies the chain: LANES.md § step 3.

--second-voice (a second voice through a speaker: an AI on a call, a phone, a played clip; the Talking Head
Explainer's README § Audio owns the rule). Its spans are transcript/voices.json, RAW clock per clip:
{"spans": [{"clip", "start", "end", "voice"}]} (the file captions.py reads). A span names its raw (`clip`, matched
case-insensitively, the way APFS matches it); a span with no `clip` is allowed only on a one-raw job, and a clip name
cuts.json does not use is refused (exit 1), so a typo never reads as "the cut dropped the replies".
The house chain is simulated offline on the raw as the master hears it (the gain, then the -6 dBFS limiter, a MONO
raw read as dual mono), and the kept speech is measured apart: the HOST over
every kept host range of the job, the SECOND voice over its kept spans, plus the second voice's true peak after the
chain. gap = host - second (LU). Over LIFT_OVER_DB the lift is ceil(gap - 1.5) whole dB, a level ride AFTER the
limiter on those spans only (its ramps inside them, so the host is never lifted), which lands the phone within 1.5 dB
of the host; at or under it, none. Being after the limiter, the lift raises the spans' peaks by the same dB, so it is
CAPPED where their true peak reaches LIFT_CEILING_DBTP (-1 dBTP): the cap and the landing peak are printed. The peak
is read on EVERY kept second-voice selection, a sliver too short to gate included, so the cap (`cap_db`) is in the JSON
whenever any kept second voice is, gap or not: a lift named by ear on a short reply is capped too.
Under MIN_SECOND_S of kept second-voice speech (or a clip whose selection is too short to gate: ebur128's -70 LUFS
floor) the gap is UNMEASURABLE: printed as a warning with lift 0 and `"unmeasurable": true` in the JSON, which
audio-polish.py --lift auto refuses. `--gain N` simulates the chain at N (the gain audio-polish.json recorded over the
covered clips) instead of the measured one: the gap moves about 1.2 dB per 3 dB into the limiter.
Nothing is written: the lane applies it (Premiere: lanes/premiere/audio-polish.py --lift auto).
