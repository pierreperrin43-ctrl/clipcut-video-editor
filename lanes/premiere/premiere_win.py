"""premiere_win.py: the Windows backend of premiere-pid.sh and premiere-dismiss.sh (both delegate here on Windows).

  python lanes/premiere/premiere_win.py pid [--name]                  # the app's pid ("Adobe Premiere Pro" with --name)
  python lanes/premiere/premiere_win.py dismiss [--check] [--key 36|53] [--tries N]

Same contract as the macOS scripts (their headers are the spec). Exit: pid 0 / 1 not running; dismiss 0 = no modal
(or dismissed), 1 = Premiere not running, 2 = a modal is still up.

Windows mechanics (2026-09-27): the app binary is `Adobe Premiere Pro.exe` (no year in the name, unlike the Mac
bundle; `tasklist` finds it exactly). A native modal DISABLES the main window (Win32 modality), so DETECT = the main
window is disabled. The modal is the enabled window OWNED by it (its GW_OWNER chain reaches the main window; a dialog
opened from a dialog is owned by the first): Premiere's save dialog is a `#32770` owned by the main window. Never just
"the biggest other window": the MCP bridge's CEP panel keeps an ownerless CEF host window (320x400 at 0,0) that was
bigger than the save dialog, so the first detector named it and a dismiss would have posted Return into the panel.
DISMISS = WM_KEYDOWN/WM_KEYUP of Return (Mac keycode 36) or Escape (53) posted straight to the modal, which lands on its
default / cancel button without fronting anything.
PROVEN on a real modal (the Windows re-test, 2026-09-27, Premiere 26.5.1): a QE razor dirtied a scratch project, the
bridge's app.quit() raised "Save changes to '<name>.prproj' before closing?" (Save / Don't Save / Cancel); `--check`
named it, `--key 53` (Cancel) cleared it with Premiere still up, and a bare dismiss (Return = Save) saved and quit.
An ExtendScript edit (a marker) does NOT dirty a project: that quit raised no dialog and dropped the marker.
