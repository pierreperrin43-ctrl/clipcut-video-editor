"""layout-keys.py: the Premiere lane's half of the talking-head layout. It bakes the plan's footage modes onto V1 as
Motion HOLD keys (S split, T tight, W wide; F and O keep W's footage under their graphic), one hard cut per switch,
and never overwrites a Motion edit the creator made by hand.

  uv run lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py projects/<job>                  # --dry (the default): the keys, offline
  uv run lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py projects/<job> --verify         # every V1 clip read back: MATCH / DRIFT / HAND
  uv run lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py projects/<job> --apply          # write, read back, prove the audio, save, record
  ... --variant ad --sequence "<job> AD"    # a second deliverable: the plan's variants.ad composed in (layout.py)
  ... --sequence "<name>"                   # a live run refuses unless the active sequence is <name> (VE_SEQUENCE too)
  ... --apply --force-clip 21[,22]          # overwrite clips classified HAND (read them with --verify first)

WHY A LAYER, NOT A CUT (layout.md § 2). The layout rotation is the pacing engine, and it is a presentation decision
independent of the edit. Razoring V1 at every switch would cost the creator his trim points, and he re-cuts by hand.
So V1's edit points stay his, and each switch is two keys on the footage's own Motion: a hard cut in the framing,
never a ramp (a ramp reads as a camera operator, a hard switch reads as an edit).

INPUTS
  graphics-plan.json `layout`  the spans, through presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/layout.py (spans(),
                               compose_variant()): the one implementation captions.py reads too, so the footage and
                               the caption switch on the same frame.
  face-frame.json `modes`      {W, S, T: {scale, centre}} through layout.modes(): scale relative to the source fitted
                               to the frame, centre = where the source centre lands, in frame fractions. Missing = exit
                               2, naming `uv run workflows/face-frame.py projects/<job> --modes`.
  the app                      the sequence's frame size and timebase, every V1 clip with its Motion, and each clip's
                               source size (ffprobe on its media path, a phone raw's rotation applied).
  --dry reads V1 off the EDL (transcript/cuts[.<variant>].json) and assumes the sequence at the source's size, which
  is the lane's rule (the sequence is the raw's size and rate), so it needs neither Premiere nor the media.

THE KEYS (plan_keys, pure)
  to_motion: Scale = 100 x mode.scale x fit (fit = sequence / source, 1 when they are the same size; another aspect is
  refused, it needs a crop decision), Position = mode.centre.
  A clip with no switch inside it gets STATIC values: its mode half a frame in. At every switch strictly inside a clip
  (more than 0.6 frame from its edges) a key ONE FRAME BEFORE carries the outgoing mode and a key ON the switch the
  incoming one, both in MEDIA time (inPoint + t - start: a clip's keys live on its source's clock, lab-notes.md).
  Nothing else: before its first key a property holds that key's value and after its last the last's, so a clip's
  opening mode needs no key of its own. Interpolation HOLD (enum 3; lab-notes.md: 0 linear, 3 hold, 4 bezier). The
  pair already makes an on-grid switch hard; hold keeps it hard when a source frame is sampled between the two keys
  (a mixed-rate source).

THE CREATOR'S HAND (the house lock: live state that disagrees with the plan is his edit, reported and left alone)
  Every V1 clip's live Motion is classified before anything is written:
    MATCH  it already equals the plan's keys: nothing to write.
    DRIFT  it is this tool's own state, off the plan: the untouched default (Scale 100, Position 0.5 0.5, no keys), or
           exactly what premiere/layout-keys[.<variant>].json records this tool wrote on that media range (a variant
           also reads the organic record, since its clone carries the organic's keys). A stale plan, a re-cut, a
           failed write. --apply rewrites it; --verify exits 1 on it.
    HAND   anything else is his: skipped and named, unless --force-clip names it. A HAND clip whose every value is one
           of this job's modes is flagged as such (an older framing pass): read it, then --force-clip it.

--apply, in order
  1. job_guard: the active project is the job's AND the active sequence passes the sequence rule.
  2. reads only: the sequence, V1 with Motion, source sizes; the keys; the classes. Nothing to write = no save.
  3. save, then a dated copy of the saved .prproj in premiere/archive/ (the rollback: a scripted edit is not undoable).
  4. an audio snapshot of every audio clip, in ticks.
  5. the writes through the bridge's es, then all of V1 read back: a written clip must equal its keys, every other
     clip must read as it did before. A miss stops the run UNSAVED.
  6. the audio snapshot again: IDENTICAL, else the run stops UNSAVED. Only then save, and write the record.
  The proofs come before the save (place-graphics.py's order), so a failed run is undone by closing without saving.

--verify reads every clip back, classifies it, prints seconds per layout mode, and exits 1 on DRIFT only (HAND is his).

NOTES
  · A graphic's Scale is place-graphics.py fit_scale's job (it sets and reads it back on every lay). The job-local
    script this generalizes set every graphic to 200 as a side effect, and so hid the swap bug fit_scale now fixes.
  · Re-run after any replay, V1 rebuild or re-cut: a fresh clip lands at the default, and a trimmed clip keeps keys
    that sit on the old clock (they read DRIFT until re-run).
  · Never re-run over a substituted clip (a lip-sync, a re-take) without --verify first. It is laid with the replaced
    clip's own framing keys and proven on the picture (framing-continuity.py); --verify names it HAND, and it is
    overwritten only by --force-clip, after its frames have been looked at.
Generalized (2026-09-23) from one job's hard-coded reframe script, which had no verify mode, cleared every key it found
and set every graphic's Scale on the way. Owner of the rule: presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/layout.md § 2.
Tests: workflows/test_layout_keys.py (offline; the ExtendScript runs in node against a synthetic Premiere).
