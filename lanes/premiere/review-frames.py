  (uv resolves Pillow from the header: the contact sheets are the only dependency)

Writes <out>/<id>-f<frame>.png, <out>/sheets/<id>.png (one contact sheet per graphic, plus
sheets/_rest.png for the untouched graphics under --rest-sheet), <out>/INDEX.md, the list
the reviewers are handed (every frame on disk with its timeline second and what to look at), and
<out>/manifest.json, what those frames depict — the placed render behind each row at grab time.

Why (2026-09-07): the loop's evidence was hand-rolled inside the job folder every run, so it
carried that job's absolute path and a hardcoded 29.97, guessed one comp directory, handed the
bridge a relative out path (which the CEP panel resolves against Premiere's own cwd, writing
nowhere while reporting success) and exited 0 with frames missing. One tool, job as an argument.
`--clear-previews` clears the sequence's render cache first: a scripted MOVE leaves stale preview
frames that the Program monitor and exportFrame keep showing where no clip exists, and a phantom
graphic is a defect a reviewer cannot tell from a real one. It is OPT-IN because the clear takes the
creator's own hand-rendered previews (the green bar) with it over the whole sequence, and a grab
after a plain place/replace does not need it: pass it after anything that MOVED clips, and after
any frame that looks like a graphic no longer on the timeline. The run prints the reminder when it
is not passed.
Two ways a round can be clean against evidence that does not depict the edit, both now hard exits:
a render that moved since the baseline round is FORCED into full sampling however --ids reads (the
_rest sheet cannot swallow it), and frames older than the render they are labelled with are deleted
with a non-zero exit — a fix applied after the grab is the hole that shipped a defect (g35, 2026-09-18).

Sample set per placed graphic (clamped to the row, frame in .. frame out-1):
  every row      in+2 (the entrance has started), mid (the readable hold), out-2 (the exit)
  HAND comps     in+6 (a pop has settled by frame 4, a rise is still mid-travel at 6), the last
                 frame before and the first frame after every internal shot cut (a <video>/<img>, or
                 an element holding one, appearing or disappearing: its data-start window, or a
                 GSAP opacity/autoAlpha/visibility/display set on it; mid-shot sampling never lands
                 there, and a leaked old thread and a reply shot 0.2 s early both passed a round
                 unseen, 2026-09-21), +4 after every registry call and every tween parsed off the
                 comp, plus the call time +2 on a `pop` or `slam` (the overshoot peaks at +3, so the
                 +4 alone never shows it), and a 1.0 s sweep frame wherever the gap it falls in is over a second
  --at picks     the hand-picked moments, on any row
Tweens closer than 6 frames are one moment (earliest wins, a registry call absorbs the tweens
around it), and the tween frames are CAPPED per graphic (--max-per-graphic, default 24, spread
evenly by TIME over what the rest leaves): a call card's per-frame waveform sets were 440 of 734
grabs (2026-09-21). The run prints every graphic the cap trimmed. The entrance/exit, registry-call,
shot-cut and --at frames are never merged or dropped (a staggered pop's +2 is its own evidence), and
the sweep is never capped: it keeps every gap under a second, and on a capture comp it is the only
evidence for a change inside a shot (the cap once took all of it, a 41-frame hole, 2026-09-23). A cut
landing on a frame already kept adds its label to that frame's line in INDEX.md.
A hand comp is a row whose kind is not `text`: the text-animation comps are generated, their
motion is the builder's, and scanning them for tl.to times floods the plan with dead frames.

Bridge grabs are PACED (--pace, 150 ms apart, 2 s every 40) and a run over 200 of them refuses
without --i-know: a 426-grab burst beach-balled Premiere into a force quit while the creator worked
(2026-09-17). `--from-export <mp4>` cuts the same frames from an exported draft with ffmpeg instead
(the output -ss, after -i, is exact): no bridge, no active-project guard, safe while the creator is
in the app. The draft must run at the sequence rate, cover every planned frame and be newer than
placement.json and every planned graphic's placed render, or the run refuses.

Reads hf-graphics/placement.json (a bare list or {"rows": [...]}), the comps under
hf-graphics/*/compositions/<id>.html (the glob workflows/graphics-qa.py uses), and takes the fps
from the job, never a constant. Grabs run through lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs `frame`,
never fronting the app, after the active-project guard (lanes/premiere/job_guard.py) has confirmed
the active project is this job's. A frame that does not land is a non-zero exit: a partial evidence set
must never feed a review round. An existing png is skipped, so a run is restartable.
A SECTION sub-job (graphics-plan.json carries `timeline_offset`) is grabbed at row time + offset and
labelled in sequence seconds; the frame numbers in the file names stay in the section's own time base.
