Every lane places graphics from the same rows: Premiere's lanes/premiere/place-graphics.py imports this module (its
--plan is this derivation), the Final Cut replay lays placement.json as connected clips, and the Resolve and CapCut
lanes read the same rows. Nothing here touches an editing app: stdlib + ffprobe only.

Rows: {"id", "file", "start", "end", "kind": "text"|"full"|"overlay"|"captions", "track": 2|3|4} (track 2 = the graphics
track, 3 = the accent track above it for a row overlapping an earlier one, 4 = the caption layer on top). The render
picked is the newest VERSION on disk (renders()); a plan whose `cut_rev` is not the job's transcript/cuts.json is
refused, and a row a ripple marked `"ripple": "orphaned"` is refused and named (the full rules:
lanes/premiere/place-graphics.py's docstring). A variant (`--variant ad`) derives graphics-plan.<variant>.json, or the
plan composed from graphics-plan.json's variants.<variant>, into hf-graphics/placement.<variant>.json.

        NOTHING ELSE. A bigger gap is a real disagreement between the plan and the build, and laundering
        it into the plan destroys the cell the gap was measured against (2026-09-19, both proved offline):
        an overlay's plan `end` is a BOUND — `derive()` reads it as `min(start + render, end)` — so writing
        the realized end back pins the graphic to the SHORTEST render it ever had, and a later extended
        re-render is then clamped back to it with nothing printed anywhere; and a text row whose meta.json
        is stale against the plan pushed 8 frames per row into your-job's plan, moving the word anchor the
        cell was written from. Those belong on screen as a gate FAIL, which says to reconcile or fix the
        placement. Unbounded stays the standalone `--sync-plan`: a row placed by hand IS the new truth.

        Neither writes a plan check_cut_rev() found unstamped and OLDER than its EDL: that age is what arms the
        --apply refusal, and a sync (even half a frame of snap rounding, which `--plan --write` finds on most
