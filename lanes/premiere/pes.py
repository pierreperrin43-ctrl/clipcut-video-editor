"""pes.py: the ONE Python runner for the Premiere bridge.

    from pes import es, paged
    from job_guard import require_job_project

    require_job_project(es, job)                       # es = the bridge runner, as the guard expects
    seq = json.loads(es('(function(){ ... })()'))
    clips = paged(lambda n0, n1: '(function(){ ... slice %d..%d ... })()' % (n0, n1))

Every call goes through `premiere-bridge.mjs es`, which owns the bridge's output contract (the
command's own comment carries it): one line of stdout, a runtime failure as `ERROR: <message> @
line <n>` with a non-zero exit, a result at or over the CEP return cap named as the cap, and a
timeout the caller passes instead of the panel's 45 s default.

Why (2026-09-19): six lane scripts each grew their OWN `def es`, every one a different guess at an
undocumented contract — a plain `json.loads` that died on any leading line, two backwards line scans
with a blind retry, a `rfind("\\n{")` with no error check at all, and a seventh copy inside a job
folder. The same session lost three round-trips to a 64 KB readback that came back as truncated JSON
rather than an error, and read a good 4.93 GB export as a failure because nobody could pass a
timeout. One runner, one contract, one place to fix the next surprise.
