"""layout.py: the executable twin of layout.md. One implementation of the frame: the mode spans, the caption height per
frame, the forced caption breaks and the layout checks. validate-plan.py, captions.py and lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py
import it, so the framing numbers and rules live here once and layout.md explains them.

  uv run presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/layout.py projects/<job>                  # tables + rules, exit 1 on a FAIL

Reads projects/<job>/graphics-plan.json (its top-level `layout`), face-frame.json (`modes`, written by
`workflows/face-frame.py projects/<job> --modes`), transcript/cuts.json (the V1 cuts), outputs/<job>.transcript.json (the
words a switch lands on) and, when it exists, hf-graphics/placement.json (the L-ALIGN placement check). A variant reads
cuts.<v>.json, outputs/<job>.<v>.transcript.json and placement.<v>.json when they exist.

THE PLAN CONTRACT (layout.md § 12). `layout` tiles 0..duration on the frame grid, on the timeline clock:
  "layout": [{"start": 0.0, "end": 4.629625, "mode": "S", "why": "the hook"},
             {"start": 9.551208, "end": 14.76475, "mode": "F", "caption_y": 1420, "why": "the escalation"}, ...]
  (a row may also be [start, end, mode] or [start, end, mode, caption_y]; `why` is carried, never read)
  S split · T tight · W wide (bare) · F full-screen graphic · O wide with a card over it.
  A row may carry its own footage transform, "frame": {"scale": s, "centre": [x, y]} (the units of face-frame.json
  `modes`), over its mode's: a take where the creator stands while the median framing is seated (the hook of the
  Windows test job put the face under the opaque panel) gets the span's own fit, measured with
  `face-frame.py projects/<job> --span A B --modes`. Every lane reads it through footage_spans().
  `caption_y` (the caption line's centre, 1080x1920) is required on F unless a cell over it carries "seam_clear": true
  (the graphic keeps the seam clear, so the line stays on the seam). On W/T/O it is only an override. An F row may give
  "ui_bottom" (the capture's bottom UI edge) instead: the line is then derived, ui_bottom + 58.5 (captions-style.md § 2).
  The captions cell (kind "captions") may carry "y": {"wide": px, "tight": px, "measured": "...", "measured_at": ISO}:
  heights read on stills and approved (captions-style.md § 2). A W/O line is the measured collar + 78.5 (face-frame.json
  `collar`); y.wide / y.tight win over it only with their `measured` note and a `measured_at` not older than the
  collar's (face-frame.json collar_read.at), or when no collar is measured.
  Graphic cells carry `family` (authored | capture | montage | overlay), `readable`, `shot_cuts`, `sync`, and an overlay
  card its box and the measured crown: "card": {"top": y, "bottom": y, "enter_top": y}, "crown": y
  (face-frame.py --crown A B; or face-frame.json "crowns": [{"start", "end", "y"}]). A montage's shots (its edges and
  its `shot_cuts`) each hold captures.md's MONTAGE_SHOT_S. The CTA cells carry "role": "cta"; a video with none has no
  ask, and L-CTA does not apply to it (layout.md § 7).
  "layout_deviations": [{"rule": "L-CTA", "why": "..."}] turns every FAIL of that rule (only the one within 0.5 s of an
  optional "at") into a WARN printed with its why.
  "variants": {"ad": {"from": t, "layout": [...], "cells": [...]}}: a second deliverable that inherits everything before
  `from`; its layout tiles `from` to its own end and its cells replace every cell from there.

face-frame.json `modes`: {"W"|"S"|"T": {"scale": s, "centre": [x, y]}}: scale relative to the source fitted to the frame
(1.0 = the untouched shot), centre = where the source's centre lands, in frame fractions (Premiere's Position on a
same-size sequence). The lanes convert them to their own units.

As a library (captions.py, lanes/premiere/layout-keys.py, validate-plan.py): spans, mode_at, caption_y_at, breaks, check,
report, compose_variant, modes, parse_fps; a missing input raises MissingInput, a broken map LayoutError.
Exit 0 = ok (warnings allowed) · 1 = a FAIL · 2 = a missing input, named by its field. Stdlib only; importing this module
has no side effects.
