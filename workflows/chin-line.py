chin-line.py — measure the chin line of a talking-head cut. Measured, not guessed.

Every overlay that shares the frame with the face lives BELOW the chin, and the
only honest way to know where the chin is is to look. This sweeps the video,
detects the face on each sample (OpenCV YuNet, model vendored in assets/models/)
and reports the LOWEST jaw line it finds — the worst case a fixed layout band has
to clear. The YuNet box bottom sits on the jaw, so it is the chin proxy.

ONE SAMPLE IS NEVER THE FLOOR (§ THE LOW BAND). The subject is the biggest CONFIDENT
face, not the biggest box and not the top score alone; and a chin no other sample
corroborates is re-sampled on the source frames either side before it is believed —
it is dropped and named only when those frames disagree with it too.

Feeds the youtube/default text-animation band (presets/youtube/default/text-animation/build.py
TOP_MIN) and any hand-authored overlay that has to sit under the face. Re-derive
per shoot: a tighter or wider frame moves the chin by 100px+.

It also reports the HEAD'S HORIZONTAL EXTENT (the face box widened by an ear allowance,
worst case over the window) and the side-callout zones that leave it alone (the user,
2026-09-10: a side card never covers the ear; margin to the subject SUBJECT px, to the
frame edge EDGE px; the card goes on the side with more room and takes the room's width).
