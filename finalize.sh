# finalize.sh <job> — the EXPORT step. Make a finished job's outputs/ unambiguous.
#
# When a job is DONE, this promotes the real final render to ONE clear deliverable
# and retires the dead drafts — so there's never confusion about which file ships.
# It also drops a copy in ~/Downloads (the "export") so the finished file is ready to grab/upload.
# It does NOT nuke the job: everything you'd need to come back and re-edit is kept.
#
# The convention it enforces in projects/<job>/outputs/:
#   <job>.final.mp4         <- THE deliverable. Ship this. (promoted from the latest render)
#   <job>.mp4              <- clean base cut (re-edit / re-caption input) — KEPT
#   <job>.transcript.json  <- KEPT
# And it leaves the hf-graphics/ SOURCE (build.py, compositions/, parts.json, PROJECT.md)
# fully intact, so the whole graphics build can be reopened and tweaked later.
#
# It does NOT reclaim disk space: a cold job leaves the working drive whole, by hand
# (to cold storage, or to the Trash).
#
# Default is a DRY RUN — it only reports the plan. Add --apply to actually do it.
#   ./finalize.sh <job>                          # show the plan
#   ./finalize.sh <job> --apply                  # promote the final + delete drafts
#   ./finalize.sh <job> --apply --keep-drafts    # promote + export copy; nothing in outputs/ deleted
#   ./finalize.sh <job> --variant ad --apply     # a second deliverable living in outputs/ad/
#
# --keep-drafts: for runs that may not hard-delete. Every would-be DELETE (old drafts, superseded
#   renders) is reported as KEEP and left on disk, and an older <job>.final.mp4 that a newer pick
#   replaces is first moved aside to <job>.draft-prev.mp4 (-2, -3.. if taken): a draft name, so it is
#   never promoted and a later plain --apply retires it like any draft. The creator removes them.
# outputs/<job>.mp4 newer than every render and the final = probably an app export on the base-cut
#   name: finalize warns, and --apply refuses (nothing moved, deleted or exported) until it's renamed.
# --variant NAME: works ONLY inside outputs/NAME/ (never outputs/*.mp4): the deliverable is
#   outputs/NAME/<job>.NAME.final.mp4, the family is <job>.NAME* / <job>-NAME*, the export copy is
#   <job>.NAME.final.mp4. A variant folder has no base cut, so <job>.NAME.mp4 is an ordinary render.
#   A plain run never looks inside outputs/NAME/.
