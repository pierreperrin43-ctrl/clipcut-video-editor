#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup.sh — ONE-COMMAND auto-setup. Detects your OS (macOS, Windows or Linux), installs
# everything the pipeline needs, bootstraps the render engine, verifies with
# check-setup.sh, then auto-detects your editing app (Premiere / Resolve / CapCut)
# and wires its lane. Safe to re-run any time: it skips what's already done and
# picks up where it left off (e.g. after a restart that refreshed PATH).
#
#   ./setup.sh
#   ./setup.sh --lane premiere|resolve|capcut|finalcut|chat-only
#       records the user's editing-app pick (asked only when several apps are
#       installed) and, for premiere/resolve/finalcut, runs that lane's installer.
#       Final Cut is macOS only, CapCut macOS and Windows; Linux: resolve or chat-only.
#   ./setup.sh --new-install
#       this folder is a second, separate install (not a new version of one already set up)
#
# macOS:   installs via Homebrew (if Homebrew itself is missing, you run its one-liner
#          once (it needs your password), then re-run this; it finds the new Homebrew in
#          /opt/homebrew or /usr/local on its own and adds it to your shell profile).
# Windows: run from Git Bash (the shell Claude Code uses on Windows); installs via
#          winget. Newly installed tools sometimes need a new terminal before they're
#          on PATH; this script pulls in their well-known install dirs so most setups
#          finish in ONE run; if anything is still pending it says exactly what to do.
# Linux:   tools are not auto-installed (./check-setup.sh prints the apt command
#          for each missing one), but everything else runs: verify, render-engine
#          bootstrap, Resolve lane detection (/opt/resolve), the done marker.
#
# Exit codes (Claude reads these; each prints exactly what to do):
#   0  done (output may carry an ACTION FOR CLAUDE line: the which-app question)
#   1  something needs fixing before continuing; the output says what (Homebrew
#      missing on macOS, brew/apt installs that did not land, a lane installer that failed)
#   2  restart needed: freshly installed tools (or Homebrew's PATH) aren't visible to
#      this session yet. Restart Claude Code, then re-run ./setup.sh; it finishes the rest.
#   3  an editing-app MCP lane was just wired into .mcp.json. Restart Claude Code
#      so it loads the new MCP (answer YES when it asks to enable this project's
#      .mcp.json servers), then verify the lane.
#
# State: .setup-complete (written once every core tool verifies) carries ONE line,
#   lane=<premiere|resolve|capcut|finalcut|chat-only|pending>
# so a later session knows which finish surface this machine uses. "pending" means the
# which-app question is still open; the SessionStart hook keeps reminding Claude until
# ./setup.sh --lane <pick> records the answer.
#
# This handles tools + the editing-app lane. Personalization (brand-kit.md) is
# OPTIONAL and separate: the editor works out of the box with the neutral bundled
# look; fill the brand kit in whenever (or never).
