# normalize-sections.sh — apply the HOUSE audio chain to every source recording in a job, as
# normalized copies, and verify nothing shifted in time. The baked step-3 chain for the Resolve and
# Final Cut lanes: Resolve swaps the copies in with lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/replace-clips.py,
# Final Cut's lanes/finalcut/replay.py lays audio-normalized/ itself.
#
#   usage: workflows/normalize-sections.sh <job_dir>
#          DRY=1 workflows/normalize-sections.sh <job_dir>            measure only, render nothing
#          AMPLIFY_DB=12 workflows/normalize-sections.sh <job_dir>    override the measured gain
#
# The chain is the same one every lane runs (LANES.md § step 3; unified 2026-09-04, the user's call):
#   gain = whatever puts the KEPT speech at -17 LUFS integrated, measured by workflows/voice-gain.py
#   from transcript/cuts.json against raw/  →  hard limiter at -6 dBFS  →  320k AAC.
# One gain per job dir (a section sub-job with its own transcript gets its own measurement).
#
# Writes normalized copies to <job_dir>/audio-normalized/. NEVER touches the raws. A copy that fails
# the drift gate is renamed <file>.DRIFT, so neither replace-clips.py nor replay.py picks it up.
# Exit 0 = every matched raw rendered and passed; 1 = a DRIFT, an error, or no raw matched any cut.
#
# Locks (full rationale in lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/README.md):
#   · -c:v copy          video is stream-copied, so the picture stays bit-identical
#   · level=disabled     alimiter auto-level otherwise defeats the measured static gain
#   · latency=1          compensates the limiter's own lookahead so nothing moves in time
#   · 320k AAC           downstream-bitrate lock: never re-encode voice below 256k
#   · NEVER loudnorm     dynamic normalization pumps
#
# Bash 3.2 clean (stock macOS) and Linux clean — no mapfile, no associative arrays.
