"""captions.py: the talking-head explainer's LOCKED caption layer, built and asserted ([captions-style.md] is the WHY).

Small white mono ALL CAPS in a see-through black box, 2-3 words a line, cut on and off with the picture, nothing
animated. Each frame's line sits where THAT frame's layout puts it (layout.py owns every height), a second voice is
yellow for its whole reply, and the text is the canonical transcript word for word. So a re-cut or a re-frame is a
re-run, never a hand edit. It runs from this folder and is never copied into a job: a job copy is how a fixed bug (the
sliver filter that deleted real words) stays alive on the next job.

  uv run presets/instagram/talking-head-explainer/captions.py projects/<job>              build, then the gate
  ... --ver b             write captions-alpha-b.mov (a placed render is never overwritten: Premiere half-stales it)
  ... --variant ad        the second deliverable: outputs/<job>.ad.transcript.json, transcript/cuts.ad.json and the
                          plan's variants.ad composed by layout.py -> captions-ad-alpha[-VER].mov, caption-sheet.ad.json
  ... --stills 6.0,20.5   current beside proposed on the raw frames -> review/caption-stills[-VER].png (a height change
                          is approved on stills before every line is re-rendered)
  ... --check <mov>       the gate on any render, against the job as it is NOW (a stale layer fails)
  ... --dry               the line table and the text gates only: nothing rendered or written

Exit 0 ok · 1 the gate failed (each failure named) · 2 bad input (the missing file, field or font named).

INPUTS (projects/<job>/):
  graphics-plan.json   `fps`; `duration`; the `layout` array and every graphic cell's in/out and `shot_cuts`
                       (layout.md § The plan contract, read through layout.py); the captions cell
                       {"id": "captions", "kind": "captions", "join": ["et cetera", "HyperFrames"], "y": {"wide": px,
                       "tight": px, "measured": "..."}}. `join` default ["et cetera"]: an entry with a space is a
                       spoken phrase kept on one line with a non-breaking space; an entry without one is a name the ASR
                       split, fused back into that one spelling. `variants.<NAME>` for --variant.
  transcript/cuts[.NAME].json            the EDL (`segments`: clip, start, end on the raw clock; `media` = a
                                         substituted file laid for that segment, read by --stills)
  outputs/<job>[.NAME].transcript.json   the canonical words (`words`: text, start, end, type) on the cut clock
  transcript/voices.json   the second voice, RAW clock, per clip, the WHOLE reply the cut keeps; no file = one voice:
                           {"spans": [{"clip": "<raw clip file>", "start": 243.9, "end": 249.75, "voice": "phone"}]}
                           (`clip` may be left out on a one-clip job; `voice` defaults to "second")
  face-frame.json      `collar` + `modes` (workflows/face-frame.py --modes): the W/O and T heights, and --stills
  hf-graphics/placement[.NAME].json   the renders on the timeline, which a build never overwrites

OUTPUTS: hf-graphics/captions/renders/captions[-NAME]-alpha[-VER].mov (ProRes 4444, yuva444p10le, straight alpha, at the
plan fps, exactly round(duration x fps) frames) and hf-graphics/captions/caption-sheet[.NAME].json ({render, fps, font,
font_warning, lines: [{text, start, end, y, voice}]}). Scratch frames in /tmp/video-editor/<job>/captions[-NAME]/.

THE GATE (after every build; --check on any render): captions == transcript (normalised characters, so a join is
free); no line spans a break; per frame, the ink centre within INK_TOL px of that frame's y; every line within MAX_W;
no frame inside a spoken word uncaptioned. GATE_BAND is the split-frame strip no graphic ink may enter:
workflows/graphics-qa-short.py reads it from here. PIL is imported lazily, so the constants and the line builder
import without it.
