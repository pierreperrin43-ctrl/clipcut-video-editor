// Engine: vendor/premiere-mcp — our pinned local clone of
// github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP (the original project; the old

// Pinned by clone: update ONLY via deliberate `git pull` + re-test, record the
// new commit hash in the premiere-pro skill.
//
// Usage:
//   node lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs --list [filter]        # list tools
//   node lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs --desc <tool|command>  # a tool's params, or a command's usage below

//
// THE GUARD. Every command that takes a job (`replay` from its cuts.json path, "job" in the opts JSON,
// `es --job`) refuses with exit 2, nothing touched, unless the ACTIVE project is the job's AND the active
// sequence passes THE SEQUENCE RULE (lanes/premiere/job_guard.py's, word for word): it must exist, belong
// to that project (by sequenceID AND by the project file its treePath names: a Save-As copy keeps every
// ID), be held by no other open project of the same file name, equal the requested name when one is given
// ("sequence" in the opts, `es --sequence`,
// else env VE_SEQUENCE), and otherwise equal the sequence named after the job folder when the project
// holds one. VE_SEQUENCE='<name>' is how a second cut of a job (an AD clone) is targeted deliberately.

//   node lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs replay <cuts.json> <clipName>

//     # pattern; append position is read back after every overwrite because
//     # Premiere quantizes boundaries to the frame grid).
//     # REFUSES (exit 2, nothing laid) when any segment carries "media": that segment was laid from
//     # substitute media (a lip-sync clip), so its raw clip is not what is on the cut. Replay an EDL
//     # without it, then `lay` it from the media's own project item.

//     # The frame is the one Premiere SHOWS at `time`: floor((time + 1e-6) / frame), never the nearest,
//     # so a grab a hair before a cut is the last frame before it. "job" in the opts runs THE GUARD
//     # ("sequence" names the one you mean); without it the grab is an ad-hoc read of whatever is
