# setup-finalcut.sh: one-command setup for the Final Cut Pro lane (macOS only). ./setup.sh runs it when Final Cut is
# the pick (./setup.sh --lane finalcut); it can also run on its own. Safe to re-run: it checks each piece and skips
# what is done.
#
# Final Cut has no scripting surface that can edit a timeline, so this lane runs a PATCHED COPY of it: SpliceKit
# (MIT, github.com/elliotttate/SpliceKit) copies Final Cut to ~/Applications/SpliceKit/, loads a bridge into the copy
# and re-signs it; the App Store app is never touched and libraries stay compatible with it. The lane then builds
# every timeline as FCPXML through Final Cut's own importer (lanes/finalcut/README.md).
#
#   1. SpliceKit.app in /Applications: the pinned release, downloaded and checked against its SHA-256
#   2. the patched copy: SpliceKit's patcher is an app, so the USER clicks Continue in it ONCE (exit 4 until then),
#      and again after every Final Cut update (the copy is a copy)
#   3. the house look as Final Cut's Custom LUT: the folded cube in ~/Library/Application Support/ProApps/Custom LUTs
#   4. the splicekit MCP: a venv in vendor/splicekit-mcp and its entry in .mcp.json
#
# Exit: 0 wired · 1 failed (the message says why) · 4 waiting on the user's one click in SpliceKit, then re-run.
